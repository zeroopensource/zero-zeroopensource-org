## Projects

### ZeroCN

Shadcn registry made by Zero. This registry provides a curated collection of reusable components, utilities, primitives, hooks, layouts, themes, and backend-ready modules — all installable directly into your project, just like shadcn/ui.

ZeroCN is designed for teams who want to install code, not packages — enabling full ownership, version control, and customizability across both frontend and backend layers.
